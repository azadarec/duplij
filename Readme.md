## Intentions

One day when I was bored (again), I decided to Code something in Java and I recognized my HDDs are stupidly cluttered.  
So I decided to learn a bit and get rid of the Boring  I could code some configurable Java Program to list duplicated  
directory names and file names and hashes. Make that thing configurable and so on. Maybe if I do not abandon it,  
it will be useful to someone else also, maybe not.

It is mainly something I wanted to learn some Java and other things with :)
Tips and Suggestions to make it better are not only welcomed but also encouraged
